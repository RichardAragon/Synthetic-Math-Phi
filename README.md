# Synthetic Math Phi

Synthetic Math Phi is a Python application that generates and solves synthetic math problems using the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct language model.

## Description

This application generates random mathematical problems across different areas (such as algebra and calculus) and difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). It then uses the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model to solve these problems, providing an automated way to create and solve a large number of diverse math problems.

## Features

- Generates synthetic math problems in various areas of mathematics
- Supports different difficulty levels for each area
- Uses the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model to solve the generated problems
- Outputs problems and solutions in JSON format

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for faster processing)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   pip install torch transformers

## Usage

To use the application, run the main script with the desired number of problems:

num_problems = 10
output = main(num_problems)
print(output)

This will generate and solve 10 math problems, outputting the results in JSON format.

## Output Format

The output is a JSON array of objects, each containing:
- `problem`: The generated math problem
- `answer`: The solution provided by the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model

## Customization

You can customize the types of problems generated by modifying the `templates` dictionary in the script. Add new areas of mathematics, difficulty levels, or problem templates as needed.

## Note

The accuracy of the solutions depends on the capabilities of the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model. Always verify important results manually.
